I often contemplate about the meaning of life, life is all about having fun but still not running away from responsibility, after watching the film SORE: Istri dari Masa Depan, i felt so emotional and the music BaraSuara: Terbuang dalam waktu is so magnificent and paired perfectly with the movie.
Seeing the MV of the song, made me wanna work even harder for both my parents since they are the ultimate thing that never forsaken me. Oh how beloved i am to have a parent like the. Me having fun in life means that i could hav efun on weekends but not runnign away from my responsibility to give my parents the best, as they have sacrificed so much stuff to give me the best stuff, oh how i love them, if i could live thousands or millions of times, i would always choose them as my parents. 
No amount of money can change my love for them, itheir love and compassion have always been the best for me, thanks to the both of them, im going to work hard and never slack off, their sacrifices have been too much.
